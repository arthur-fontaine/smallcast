# Development

How to build, test, package, and release Smallcast.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 or later (Liquid Glass).
- Xcode 26 installed — it provides the SwiftUI macro plugin and SDK used to build.

## First-time setup

Create the `Smallcast Self-Signed` code-signing identity once — builds sign with it, which keeps the
macOS Accessibility grant from being forgotten every rebuild. Follow **[signing.md](signing.md) §1**
(a few `openssl`/`security` commands).

## Build & run

Open the project in Xcode and run it:

```sh
open Smallcast.xcodeproj    # then press ⌘R
```

Or from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Smallcast.xcodeproj -scheme Smallcast -configuration Debug build
```

`xcodebuild` uses whatever `xcode-select` points at; if that's the Command Line Tools rather than
Xcode, prefix with `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` (the SwiftUI
`@State`/`@FocusState` macros need Xcode's macOS platform).

`Smallcast.xcodeproj` is committed and generated from `project.yml` via
[XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) — after changing project settings in `project.yml`,
run `xcodegen generate` and commit the result.

### The dev channel

Debug builds are a separate channel: **`Smallcast Dev.app`**, bundle id `com.smallcast.app.dev`. Since
every persisted thing is keyed by bundle
id — `~/Library/Preferences/<id>.plist` (settings + hotkey bindings),
`~/Library/Caches/<id>/` (clipboard history, calculator history, frequent emoji),
`~/Library/Application Support/<id>/` (the onboarding marker), the `SMAppService` login item, and the
Accessibility / Input Monitoring (TCC) grants — a build you run locally can't read or clobber the
installed app's state, and both can run side-by-side.

Consequences worth knowing:

- The dev build asks for Accessibility on its own the first time, and starts with **no** hotkeys bound
  and onboarding unseen. Grant + bind once; it persists across rebuilds (the fixed build path and the
  `Smallcast Self-Signed` identity keep the TCC grant alive).
- Don't bind the same global hotkey in both — whichever registered first wins.
- The Hyper Key's Caps Lock remap is `hidutil` state, which is **system-wide, not per-bundle**:
  quitting one build clears the remap for the other, which then needs a rebind (or relaunch) to
  restore it.

### Editor (VS Code) code-intelligence

Autocomplete / go-to-definition come from SourceKit-LSP driven by a `buildServer.json`. Generate it
once (it's machine-specific and git-ignored):

```sh
brew install xcode-build-server
xcode-build-server config -project Smallcast.xcodeproj -scheme Smallcast \
    --build_root "$PWD/build/DerivedData"
```

`--build_root` matches the fixed path the VS Code build task / F5 use, so the editor indexes what you
actually build. Do a build once (⌘⇧B or F5) to populate it. In VS Code, **F5** builds and launches the
app; changes always apply (fixed build path — no need to delete `build/`).

## The extension runtime

`Smallcast/Resources/RaycastRuntime.generated.js` (React + a reconciler + the `@raycast/api` shim + the
Node/web polyfills JavaScriptCore lacks) is **generated and committed**, so a plain app build needs no
Node. Regenerate it only when changing `Tools/raycast-runtime/src/`:

```sh
cd Tools/raycast-runtime
pnpm install
node gen-enums.mjs        # only after bumping the @raycast/api devDependency
node build.mjs            # -> Smallcast/Resources/RaycastRuntime.generated.js (commit it)
```

Details, the supported API surface and the known gaps: [`extensions.md`](extensions.md).

## Tests

There's no XCTest target. Standalone harnesses, all compiling the **real** sources:

```sh
swiftc Smallcast/Core/FuzzyMatch.swift Tools/fuzz-test.swift \
    -o /tmp/fuzz-test && /tmp/fuzz-test                            # launcher fuzzy matcher
swiftc Smallcast/Core/Calculator/*.swift Tools/calc-test.swift \
    -o /tmp/calc-test && /tmp/calc-test                            # calculator engine
swiftc Smallcast/Core/Emoji/{EmojiCatalog,EmojiGridGeometry,EmojiData.generated}.swift \
    Tools/emoji-test.swift -o /tmp/emoji-test && /tmp/emoji-test    # emoji catalog + grid geometry
swiftc -parse-as-library -swift-version 6 \
    Smallcast/Core/Extensions/{ExtensionRuntime,ExtensionNodeShims,ExtensionBootConfig,ExtensionManifest,ExtensionScreen,ExtensionCatalog,ExtensionFetcher,RenderNode}.swift \
    Smallcast/Core/FuzzyMatch.swift Smallcast/Core/Compression/Zlib.swift \
    Tools/ext-test.swift -o /tmp/ext-test && /tmp/ext-test         # extension runtime (JavaScriptCore)
```

That the harnesses compile the shipped sources is why `Smallcast/Core/Calculator/` and
`Smallcast/Core/Emoji/` must stay Foundation-only, and why `FuzzyMatch` is its own Foundation-only file.

`ext-test` also runs any installed extension and prints the tree it renders:

```sh
/tmp/ext-test ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.smallcast.app.dev/extensions/<name> [command]
```

The JS half has its own faster loop, which needs no Swift build:

```sh
cd Tools/raycast-runtime
node fixtures.mjs                                          # runtime fixtures in a bare `vm` context
node test.mjs ~/.config/raycast/extensions/<uuid> [command]  # any prebuilt extension
```

## Packaging a DMG

For a local signed DMG:

```sh
./build-dmg.sh            # -> build/Smallcast-<version>.dmg (version from project.yml)
./build-dmg.sh 0.5.7      # -> build/Smallcast-0.5.7.dmg
```

It builds a Release `Smallcast.app` signed with `Smallcast Self-Signed` and packs it (with an
`/Applications` symlink). Official per-channel releases (beta/stable) are built by CI — see
below and [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Signing & Gatekeeper

Both local builds and CI releases sign with the same stable `Smallcast Self-Signed` identity (not an
Apple Developer ID), so macOS quarantines a directly-downloaded DMG — the Homebrew cask strips that
automatically, and direct downloaders run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "…/Smallcast.app"` once.
Full details in [signing.md](signing.md).

## CI releases

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds and publishes a DMG from GitHub Actions — no local machine
needed. Run it from the **Actions** tab (`Release` → **Run workflow**) and pick:

- **channel** — `beta` or `stable`. Each builds a distinct app
  (`Smallcast Beta.app` / `Smallcast.app`) with its own bundle id, alongside the local
  `Smallcast Dev.app` (above).
  Beta gets an auto-incrementing `-beta.N` suffix (`N` = the Actions run number)
  so re-running never collides; stable ships the version as-is.
- **version** — base semver, e.g. `0.2.0`.

It builds on a `macos-26` runner with Xcode 26 and publishes a GitHub Release tagged
`v<full-version>` with a versioned DMG asset (`Smallcast-<full-version>.dmg`), marked prerelease
for beta. On success it also bumps the matching cask in the tap (below).

### Homebrew tap automation

The release job's final step rewrites the `version` + `sha256` of the channel's cask (`smallcast`
or `smallcast@beta`) in the
[`homebrew-smallcast`](https://github.com/arthur-fontaine/homebrew-smallcast) tap and pushes. It needs a
`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` repo secret — a fine-grained PAT with **Contents: read/write** on the tap
repo. Without the secret the step logs a warning and skips (the release still publishes).

## Website

`.github/workflows/website.yml` builds `website/` (Vite + React + TS) and deploys it to GitHub
Pages at `https://abue-ammar.github.io/tinycast/` on every push to `main` that touches
`website/`. Enable it once via **Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions**.

```sh
cd website && npm install && npm run dev     # local preview
```
